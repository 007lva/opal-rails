# Opal/Rails adapter

For Rails 3.2 only.


## Installation

In your `Gemfile`

``` ruby
gem 'opal-rails'
```


## Usage

### Asset Pipeline

``` js
// app/assets/application.js

// The main Opal VM
// require opal

// optional jQuery-like DOM manipulation for Opal
// require rquery
```

and then just use the `.opal` extensions:

```ruby
# app/assets/javascripts/hi-world.js.opal

puts "G'day world!"
```



### As a template

You can use it for your dynamic templates too (Probably in conjunction with ERB to pass dynamic state)

```ruby
# app/views/posts/show.js.opal.erb

Element.id('<%= dom_id @post %>').show
```


### As an Haml filter (optional)

Of course you need to require `haml-rails` separately since its presence is not assumed

```haml
-# app/views/posts/show.html.haml

%article= post.body

%a#show-comments Display Comments!

.comments(style="display:none;")
  - post.comments.each do |comment|
    .comment= comment.body

:opal
  Document.ready? do
    Element.id('show-comments').on :click do
      Element.find('.comments').first.show
      false # aka preventDefault
    end
  end
```
